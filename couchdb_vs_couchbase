Apache CouchDB vs. Couchbase

While related from a technology perspective, Apache CouchDB and Couchbase have
significantly different capabilities that support very different application
developer needs and use cases. For example, Couchbase - like Membase - has a
built-in, memcached-based caching technology that consistently provides sub
millisecond read/write performance and is capable of hundreds of thousands of
ops per second per node. Apache CouchDB is a disk-based database that usually
is better suited for use cases where super low latency or high throughput is
not a requirement. Couchbase also has a built-in clustering system that allows
data to be automatically spread across multiple nodes. Apache CouchDB, on the
other hand, is a single node solution with peer-to-peer replication technology
and is better suited for decentralized systems and for holding data amounts
that do not need to be spread out across multiple nodes.

Even though use cases and capabilities are very different between Couchbase and
Apache CouchDB, of course they do have things in common. Both are NoSQL
document databases using JSON as their document format. The strong influence of
Apache CouchDB on the storage approach means that Couchbase also uses an
append-only file format and fundamentally the same approach to indexing and
querying as Apache CouchDB; it just extends and optimizes it to the distributed
case. Finally, Apache CouchDB replication technology is the underlying
technology for Couchbase cross datacenter replication.
